                <hr>
                <p>India achieved independence from the British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the success of the Indian independence movement which was led by Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. This was enacted through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of the British Commonwealth.[1] India became a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. Without a standalone constitution, its laws were based on the existent Government of India Act 1935 and governed by the Constituent Assembly of India.</p>
                
                <p>On 29 August 1947, a seven member drafting committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with B R Ambedkar as chairman.[3] A draft constitution prepared by the committee was submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1948.[4] After the draft was discussed and debated, the constituent assembly adopted the constitution on 26 November 1949.[5] The major part of the constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950 with Rajendra Prasad becoming the first President of India and the constituent assembly became the Parliament of India under the transitional provisions of the new constitution.[6][7] The date was chosen as the Indian National Congress proclaimed Purna Swaraj (complete independence) on this day in 1930</p>
